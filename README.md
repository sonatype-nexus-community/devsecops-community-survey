# DevSecOps Community Survey Questions

## Overview

As part of our Sonatype's commitment to DevSecOps and to determine the pulse of DevSecOps in our community, we've decided to open source the questions we used for the 2020 DevSecOps Community Survey. 

The latest DevSecOps Community Survey results can be found at [https://sonatype.com/2020Survey](https://sonatype.com/2020Survey)

### Contributions

*We encourage you to contribute!*

Please feel free to clone this repository and create a pull request so we can review your suggestions and potentially include them in the survey. Suggestions that are accepted and merged into these survey questions will be used in next year's DevSecOps Community Survey.

If you need help creating a Pull Request, you can reference Github's documentation [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)



## The Survey

### Welcome! Let's start with a view of your organization.

*All answers are kept completely anonymous and private, we only share aggregated statistics. As a survey participant, you will receive a copy of the results once compiled into our final survey document (email address required).*
